# FFT-CDDP
Trajectory optimization for a missile model using Flexible Final Time Constrained Differential Dynamic Programming (FFT-CDDP).  

The code is for my paper "[Constrained Trajectory Optimization with Flexible Final Time for Autonomous Vehicles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9582791)".
